# `toa_animator`

An opinionated 2d animator.

## Todo:
- [ ] Create the art format: #1
- [ ] Add offsets/marker components for sub graphics
- [ ] Add sub graphics/animations
- [ ] Add sound effect markers to animations
- [ ] Add tweening markers to animations
- [ ] Create the basic animation editor cli (https://github.com/NoahShomette/Astroculture-or-Bust/issues/21)
- [ ] Create a basic widget for the editor so it can be dropped into any other projects
- [ ] Create a basic standalone editor
- [ ] Create a one place storage for animations, sound, tweens.
  - [ ] Add a trait based getter from this storage to enable custom modifications of the animations (Maybe just do this under leafwing manifest? Or instead require registering specific markers for each type that will be automatically handled and allow passing in a custom function)
